# Size distributions over time {#app:size-time}

Comparison of fish lengths sampled in the Small-mesh Multi-species (SMMS)  and the Synoptic West Coast Vancouver Island (SYN WCVI) bottom trawl surveys over time. Species are ordered by decreasing median size differences observed between the two surveys (Figure \@ref(fig:size-dist-time)). 

(ref:size-time0-cap) Same as Figure \@ref(fig:size-dist-time) for additional species.

(ref:size-time1-cap) Same as Figure \@ref(fig:size-dist-time) for additional species.

(ref:size-time2-cap) Same as Figure \@ref(fig:size-dist-time) for additional species.

(ref:size-time3-cap) Same as Figure \@ref(fig:size-dist-time) for additional species.
