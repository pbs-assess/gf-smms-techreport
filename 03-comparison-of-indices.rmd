# Comparing the SMMS survey indices to related indices {#sec:comparing-indices}

The SMMS is the longest running continuous bottom trawl survey on the BC coast.
As a long-running annual dataset for groundfish, it is therefore important to understand how well the data capture trends in species biomass.
The change in survey locations over time (e.g., Figure \@ref(fig:spatial-shift)) means that a modelled index, which accounts for latent spatial effects, may be a better approach than a design-based index.
We compared the modelled SMMS survey indices to the SMMS design-based indices, modelled SYN WCVI indices, and the modelled commercial catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) indices from the Pacific Marine Fisheries Commission (PMFC) areas for West Coast Vancouver Island (areas 3C and 3D).
These datasets overlap spatially (Figure \@ref(fig:mssm-syn-cpue-map)) and the commercial CPUE 3CD time series extends back to 1996 allowing a comparison to species abundance indices prior to the 2001--2003 sorting procedure changes. 

(ref:mssm-syn-cpue-map) Spatial overlap of the Small-mesh Multi-species survey (SMMS; green) compared to (a) the West Coast Vancouver Island synoptic bottom trawl (WCVI; purple) and (b) the commercal catch-per-unit-effort data from the Pacific Marine Fisheries Commission (PMFC) areas for West Coast Vancouver Island (CPUE 3CD; orange). 
The CPUE 3CD data locations are shown as 7 km wide hexagon bins that implement the 3-vessel privacy requirement.
Hexagon bins for fishing from 1996 onwards are illustrated with white (open) hexagons with a grey border.
Solid orange hexagons from 2013 onwards (after the trawl footprint was frozen) are overlaid.
Therefore, visible white hexagons indicate areas of the commercial trawl footprint that have not been fished (by three or more vessels) from 2013 onwards.

We calculated design-based indices following a standard depth-stratified mean estimator.
For each year, an average catch was calculated for each of two depth strata and then multiplied by each stratum's area. 
Confidence intervals were estimated using a stratified bootstrap procedure with 1000 replicates [see Appendix F in @anderson2019synopsis].

For the modelled SMMS indices, SYN WCVI indices, and commercial CPUE 3CD indices, we used the model outputs from @anderson2024synopsis. 
Briefly, spatiotemporal models were fit to the data from the SMMS and the SYN WCVI using the R [@r2023] package sdmTMB [@anderson2022sdmTMB]. 
Models were only fit to species that had a proportion of positive sets $\ge$ 5%.
Six species in the SMMS data did not have catch weights prior to 2003 because they were likely identified only at a higher taxonomic classification. 
For these species, the proportion of positive sets was calculated for 2003 to present.
However, of these species, only Blackbelly Eelpout met the 5% coverage threshold to be modelled.

The spatiotemporal models for both the SMMS and SYN WCVI surveys were fit with constant spatial Gaussian Markov random fields (GMRFs) and spatiotemporal GMRFs. 
If models did not converge [criteria defined in @anderson2024synopsis], then the spatial random field was turned off (i.e., set to zero) and only the spatiotemporal random field was included.
The spatiotemporal component, however, differed in structure between the surveys: for the SMMS indices, the GMRFs were structured as a random walk to account for the changes in the sampling domain over time.
For the SYN WCVI, which has a consistent sampling domain over time, the spatiotemporal component was structured using independent GRMFs with a common variance along with independent annual means.
For each survey and species, five possible families were considered: Tweedie, delta-gamma, delta-lognormal, Poisson-link delta-gamma, and Poisson-link delta-lognormal [@thorson2018three; @anderson2024synopsis].
From these models, the model with the lowest marginal AIC (Akaike information criterion) was selected and used in this report.
We omitted poorly fitted models: those which did not meet convergence criteria [@anderson2024synopsis], those where the maximum width of the CIs was greater than 10 times the maximum estimated biomass, and those where the mean coefficient of variation was > 1.

To derive area-weighted biomass indices, the models were then used to estimate abundance across standardised sampling grids.
For the SMMS, the sampling domain was defined by first creating a 3 $\times$ 3 km grid covering the extent of all survey set locations in WCVI Shrimp Survey Areas 124 and 125.
Any grid cell that intersected with more than one survey location was retained.
Then we subsetted this grid to cells that were last sampled between 2009 and 2021 (Figure \@ref(fig:historical-grid)).
This time period covered the most consistently sampled locations in recent years.
In 2022 and 2023, additional stations were sampled that had been either infrequently sampled or not sampled since 1975; so these grid cells were not used to estimate a biomass index.
For the SYN WCVI, we compared indices predicted on the standard 2 $\times$ 2 km grid covering the extent of the SYN WCVI sampling domain, but also on the 3 $\times$ 3 km SMMS grid. 

We derived standardised commercial catch per unit effort (CPUE) indices from [@anderson2024synopsis] outputs using methods described in [@anderson2019synopsis Appendix D].
Briefly, the standardization uses a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) with a Tweedie observation likelihood and a log link fitted with the 'glmmTMB' R package [@glmmTMB].
Binned (factor) covariates are included for depth, latitude, and month.
An additional factor predictor is included for year.
Locality (spatial polygon), a locality-year interaction, and fishing vessel are treated as random intercepts.
The coefficients on the factor year effects are considered the standardised index.

## Comparison of modelled and design-based indices of abundance

Trends in each species index were similar between the model-based and design-based SMMS indices.
However, for most species, the design-based index had more variable annual mean estimates compared with the modelled index and larger confidence intervals around these estimates (Figure \@ref(fig:mssm-model-design)).
Design-based indices for Yellowtail Rockfish, Bocaccio, Canary Rockfish, and Redstripe Rockfish had the greatest deviations from their respective modelled indices.
For species with insufficient data for modelling (< 5% positive sets) or where models did not meet convergence checks, we have shown the design-based index on its own for reference (Figure \@ref(fig:design-indices)).

Time series with a solid trend line and shaded ribbon for 95% confidence intervals (CI) represent the modelled index, which was predicted on 3 $\times$ 3 km grid (Figure \@ref(fig:historical-grid)).
Open circles represent design-based mean estimates and vertical lines represent 95% bootstrap CIs.
Indices have been scaled to have the same geometric mean for each species.
Vertical axes are scaled between zero and the maximum upper CI value of the modelled index.
Years before 2003 are shaded grey to indicate that catch observations in the SMMS survey are considered less reliable than modern data.
'Mean CV' is the mean of the annual coefficients of variation (CVs) for the modelled (M) and design-based (D) indices.
'Mean $+$ve sets' is the ratio of the mean number of sets that captured the species of interest to the mean number of sets.

## Comparison of SMMS to other indices in the same region

We visually compared the modelled SMMS indices with the modelled commercial CPUE 3CD and SYN WCVI indices.
This included a comparison of SYN WCVI indices predicted on the same grid used for the SMMS index.
To assess whether lower correlations in earlier years resulted from improvements in catch sorting procedures, we compared the 10-year rolling window correlation between the modelled SMMS and three indices: CPUE 3CD, SYN WCVI, and SYN WCVI predicted on the SMMS grid.

Overall, the modelled SMMS indices were more variable, with larger fluctuations over time relative to the other indices (Figures \@ref(fig:mssm-cpue), \@ref(fig:mssm-syn-wcvi), \@ref(fig:mssm-syn-wcvi-mssm)).
The trends in the SMMS and SYN WCVI indices were similar across more species when we estimated both indices using the same SMMS grid (Figures \@ref(fig:mssm-syn-wcvi-mssm), \@ref(fig:rolling-window-correlation)) than compared to SYN WCVI indices predicted over the full SYN WCVI survey grid (Figure \@ref(fig:mssm-syn-wcvi)).
This is expected given that using the same grid better captures matching spatial patterns and covariates, such as depth, that can affect species distributions (Figure \@ref(fig:depth-dist)). Twenty out of the twenty-seven species had a correlation $\ge$ 0.5 between the full time series.

The average correlation between the SMMS and the SYN WCVI predicted on the SMMS grid increased early in the time series (Figure \@ref(fig:rolling-window-correlation)).
However, the comparison of the SMMS with the SYN WCVI indices coincides with the most important change in 2003 of full species identification and quantification (Table \@ref(tab:change-table)).
The low correlations in early years appear to be driven by Dover Sole, Slender Sole, English Sole, Pacific Sanddab, and Darkblotched Rockfish, but it is unclear how this could be driven by sorting changes.

The commercial CPUE 3CD data precedes the 2003 change in sorting procedure on the SMMS.
However, the rolling window correlations were more variable and generally lower between the SMMS and the CPUE 3CD indices (Figure \@ref(fig:rolling-window-correlation)).
The average correlation between the SMMS and the CPUE 3CD indices was lower in the years prior to 2003 than after, which is driven by low correlations in Bocaccio and Redstripe Rockfish in early years.
When the full time series were compared, only 10/21 of the species had correlations $\ge$ 0.5.
