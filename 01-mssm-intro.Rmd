# Introduction

Fisheries and Oceans, Canada (DFO) has conducted annual surveys at fixed stations in shrimp grounds off West Coast Vancouver Island (WCVI) since 1973.
Formerly known as the "Shrimp Survey", this survey was designed to collect data to assess stock status of Pink Shrimp (*Pandalus jordani*) populations.
Groundfish species have also been quantified and sampled in this survey, and it is now known as the Small-mesh Multi-species bottom trawl survey (SMMS).

The SMMS survey is one of the longest continuous bottom trawl time series for groundfish off the west coast of Vancouver Island (WCVI).
The survey therefore has the potential to serve as an important historical baseline, given that the current synoptic bottom trawl surveys used to produce fisheries-independent population indices along the coast of British Columbia only began in or after 2003 and usually occur biennially in any given region.
Although DFO Technical Working Groups have frequently considered including SMMS indices in groundfish stock assessments, the indices are typically excluded due to uncertainties around whether they reflect relative biomass density through time.
The survey has undergone several changes that likely affect interpretation of indices and biological samples, and to date this has not been systematically examined across species.
It is also unclear whether the groundfish data from the SMMS provide new information not already captured in the synoptic bottom trawl survey off the west coast of Vancouver Island (SYN WCVI).

In this report we:

1. Highlight changes that may affect interpretation of the groundfish data (e.g., changes to the fishing gear, sorting protocols, species identification) ([Section \@ref(sec:summary-of-changes)](#sec:summary-of-changes)).
2. Compare spatiotemporal model-based indices of relative population biomass with traditional design-based indices ([Section \@ref(sec:comparing-indices)](#sec:comparing-indices)).
3. Investigate how well historical SMMS groundfish data may represent trends in biomass by comparing modeled SMMS indices with indices from two other sources in the same region (the SYN WCVI survey and commercial catch per unit effort [CPUE] in groundfish management area 3CD) ([Section \@ref(sec:comparing-indices)](#sec:comparing-indices)).
4. Compare differences in sampling and information captured in the SMMS and SYN WCVI surveys ([Section \@ref(sec:sampling-differences)](#sec:sampling-differences)).
5. Evaluate whether the SMMS provided an earlier signal of recruitment for several rockfish species given its smaller mesh than the SYN WCVI ([Section \@ref(sec:recruitment)](#sec:recruitment)).
