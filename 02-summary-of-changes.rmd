# Summary of changes to the SMMS survey and implications for groundfish indices {#sec:summary-of-changes}

To highlight changes that could affect interpretation of the groundfish data, we extracted data from the GFBio database for 1975--2023 [@databases2023].
A publicly available dataset is also available on the Ocean Biodiversity Information System (OBIS) [@mssm2022obis].

## Survey timing and area

The SMMS is typically conducted in the last week of April to the first weeks of May with the exception of late surveys in 1985 and 1987 (Table \@ref(tab:change-table) Appendix A).
In 1977 and 1978, additional surveys were conducted in September on commercial vessels, but these have been excluded from this report.
The consistency in survey timing means that timing is unlikely to affect abundance indices. 

The SMMS survey is a fixed station survey with transects run in an east-west direction [@rutherfordinprep].
Over the years, the extent of the survey has decreased (Figure \@ref(fig:historical-grid)).
In part, this is likely because in early years, when shrimp were caught near the east or west boundaries of the survey area, additional trawls would be carried out in these directions until shrimp stopped being caught (Personal communication: D.T. Rutherford).
Between 1975 and 1977, there was a noticeable shift in sampling locations relative to subsequent years (Figure \@ref(fig:spatial-shift)).
It is possible that this reflects surveys used to establish the extent of the shrimping grounds (Personal communication: D.T. Rutherford). 
This could also be the result of using the less accurate Loran A navigation system or bias in the conversion.

Since 2022, sampling was extended eastward and northward to cover the original extent better than any year since 1975 (Figure \@ref(fig:spatial-shift)).
Changes in spatial coverage over time mean that an index standardized using a model-based approach may be better suited for calculating an index over the full time series than a design-based index.

```{r historical-grid, fig.cap="Grid coverage based on the year a grid cell was last sampled. Darker shades indicate more recent years (e.g., the modern sampling grid 2009 - 2021) and lighter shades correspond to changes in navigation systems (1979 and 1998).

```

The navigation system used in the SMMS survey has changed twice: once in 1979 from Loran A to Loran C and again in 1998 from Loran C to the Global Positioning System (GPS) (Figure \@ref(fig:historical-grid)) [@rutherfordinprep].
The improved accuracy of GPS means that early survey locations may therefore be less accurate.
As a result of this enhanced positioning, @sinclair2001pcod observed a trend of decreasing distance traveled over time, with shorter distances recorded for the 30-minute tows in the SMMS survey. 
Additionally, the spatial consistency of fixed station trawl paths has increased over time.
Before 1998, the proportion of overlap was less than 20\% within a ten-year window (Figure \@ref(fig:trawl-overlap)).
This overlap increased markedly after 2009, with recent sampling having a trawl area overlap of ~50\% in ten-year windows (Figure \@ref(fig:trawl-overlap));
this is coincident with the implementation of GFBioField for electronic data capture and route planning (Table \@ref(tab:change-table)).
The higher consistency in fixed station sampling increased may affect the interpretation of indices of abundance for species susceptible to local depletion.
This includes species such as rockfish, which have long lifespans and high site fidelity [e.g., @hannah2011].

## Gear changes

Gear changes occurred in 1977, 2006, 2007, and 2011 (Table \@ref(tab:change-table)).
In 1977, the net, foot rope, and doors were changed.
The 70 foot (21.3 m) semi-balloon shrimp net was replaced with the National Marine Fisheries Science (NMFS) 61 foot (18.6 m) shrimp trawl net [@rutherfordinprep].
However, no calibration tows were performed; therefore, it is not possible to 
account for possible changes in catchability or gear selectivity.

In 2006, the NMFS net was replaced with a 61 foot (18.6 m) American shrimp trawl net (Table \@ref(tab:change-table)).
However, only two replicate tows were collected [see Table 2 and 3 in @rutherfordinprep].
Two tows were made at two different locations; each location was first fished with the NMFS net on May 2nd and then again on May 4th with the American shrimp trawl net.
In these two tows, there were three groundfish species not caught in the NMFS net and seven groundfish species not caught in the American net (Figure \@ref(fig:net-comp)).
The mean catch of these species was less than 10 kg in the net that did catch them.
The reliance on two sets of calibration tows means that it is challenging to account for any changes in catchability or gear selectivity in population indices. 
Furthermore, the visual comparison of only two comparative tows does not provide a clear indication of how the gear change affected catchability (Figure \@ref(fig:net-comp)).

```{r net-comp, fig.cap="Mean catch of species caught in two sets of comparative tows of gear in 2006. The 61 foot National Marine Fisheries Service (NFMS) net was used between 1977--2005 and the 61 foot American shrimp trawl net has been used from 2006--present. Only two sets of comparison trawls were done with each net at two locations in 2006."}

## Catch sorting and sampling

```{r}
post_2003_spp <- readRDS(here::here("data-outputs/post-2003-spp.rds"))
```

The most notable change to catch sorting and sampling occurred from 2001 to 2003. 
From 2001--present the entire catch was sorted wherever possible and from 2003--present all species were sorted and identified to the species or to the lowest taxonomic level possible [@rutherfordinprep].
For large volumes of catch, or catches with a large number of small organisms, the total catch was sub-sampled and the total catch was visually estimated or weighed.
From 2021 onwards, when the CCGS Franklin vessel was used, the 600 kg bin scale allowed full weighing of most tows instead of visual or other estimation methods for large catches (Table \@ref(tab:change-table); @williams2020).

Prior to 2003, `r length(post_2003_spp)` species had zero catch weights and catch counts.
Of these, six species were caught regularly: Big Skate, Sandpaper Skate, Longnose Skate, Blackbelly Eelpout, Stripetail Rockfish, and Slim Sculpin (Figures \@ref(fig:sampling-2003-other), \@ref(fig:sampling-2003-rockfishes)).
All flatfish species caught to date were also caught and recorded prior to 2003 (Figure \@ref(fig:sampling-2003-flatfishes)).

```

To check if some species were identified at higher taxonomic levels prior to 2003, we extracted data from GFBio for higher order taxonomies of species observed in the SMMS survey since 2003.
Flatfishes were recorded at the species-level throughout the duration of the SMMS survey (Figure \@ref(fig:spp-aggregate-plot)); however, they were recorded at the order/family level in 1977 (~23\% of catch) and 2002 (< 0.1\% of catch). 
Rockfishes have also been identified to the species-level throughout the SMMS survey (Figure \@ref(fig:spp-aggregate-plot)). 
In ten years, some rockfish were recorded at a higher taxonomic level, the total recorded biomass was < 0.1\%, except for in 2019 (6.7\% of total catch) and 2021 (1.6% of total catch) (\@ref(fig:spp-aggregate-plot)). 

Prior to 2003, when skates, eelpouts, and sculpins were caught, they were recorded at the family level (Figure \@ref(fig:spp-aggregate-plot)).
In 2002, abnormally high catch weights of "Eelpouts" and "Skates" were recorded (Figure \@ref(fig:spp-aggregate-plot)).
These outliers do not appear to reflect a decimal recording error, duplicated data (there were three high "Skate" sets in 2002), nor is it likely that it is due to a misidentification since these are easily distinguished from other species groups.
It is possible that these species aggregates were data entry errors (e.g., species coding errors) or that in the case of skates, a few large skates were caught.

Species that were possibly misidentified prior to 2003 include (Personal communications: D.T. Rutherford, M. Wyeth, S. Hardy):

- Stripetail Rockfish as Sharpchin Rockfish
- Yellowmouth as Pacific Ocean Perch
- Small Yelloweye may have been mixed in with Canary Rockfish
- Small Pacific Cod as Pacific Tomcod
- Petrale Sole as Flathead Sole (at all sizes that Flathead Sole are observed)

For example, recorded abundances of Pacific Tomcod decrease after 2003, and it is possible that this is because of misidentified Pacific Cod prior to 2003 (Figure \@ref(fig:cod-comparison)).
However, these abundances were relatively small, with annual catch sizes of Pacific Tomcod typically less than 5 kg/year.
